# Day 2: String Manipulation Programs

This folder contains basic string manipulation programs to enhance understanding of core Python string operations. The programs include tasks such as reversing a string, checking for palindromes, counting vowels and consonants, and more.

### 1. **Reverse String**
- **Description**: This program takes a string as input and reverses it.
- **How it works**: It uses Python slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse the string.

### 2. **Check if String is Palindrome**
- **Description**: This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
- **How it works**: It compares the string with its reversed version and returns `True` if they are equal.

### 3. **String Length Without Using `len()`**
- **Description**: This program calculates the length of a string without using the built-in `len()` function.
- **How it works**: It iterates through each character of the string and counts them manually.

### 4. **Remove Spaces from a String**
- **Description**: This program removes all spaces from a given string.
- **How it works**: It uses Python's `replace()` method to remove spaces from the string.

### 5. **Count Vowels and Consonants**
- **Description**: This program counts the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
- **How it works**: It iterates over each character of the string, checks whether it is a vowel or consonant, and counts them.

### 6. **Character Frequency Counter**
- **Description**: This program counts the frequency of each character in a string.
- **How it works**: It uses a dictionary to track the frequency of each character as the program iterates through the string.
